Team Project Progress Report
Ching Yuen Ng/ Brian Rak
Week 5

Summary of Progress:
This week we have set up the plant, the water flow for our project. Also make 
enchantment for our LCD and the stand by mode. We still not have the 
rechargeable battery at this point so there is no way we can attach the solar
panel to our board. We will power our board by using the normal DC.

Weekly progress:
-Enchant LCD graphic
-get the LSI working
-able to set the time by using the data from another board
-set up the plant and tubing

Challenges: 
There was a bug when I first set the time by using the data from the other board.
Since it will keep sending the time to my board, if I keep setting it then it will 
crash at some point. To solve this problem, I will only set the time to my LSI once.

We have to use tape for the tubing that attached to the motor becuase we couldn't find a
tube that's fit size.
